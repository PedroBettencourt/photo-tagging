# Photo tagging app

A version of a photo tagging app, in the style of where's waldo.

The user has to find in the image 3 characters. When fiding them, they have to click the image and choose which character they found. If it is correct, that character will be grayed out and a spot on the image will be placed.

When finishing the game, the user will be able to add their name to the leaderboard which has users' times.

The app was built using React for the frontend, Express for the backend, and Prisma for the leaderboard database.

[It is deployed here using render](https://proverb-clicker-kdlw.onrender.com).

Below is an image of the app.
